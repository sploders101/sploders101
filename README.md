### Welcome to my profile!

My name is Shaun Keys. I am an employee at Charter Communications who enjoys writing software in Vue, TypeScript, SCSS, and Rust.

In my free time, I'm working on SimplyDMX, an iceburg-style stage lighting program designed to be simple on the surface, with a lot more flexibility underneath that runs on Mac, Linux, iPad, and Windows. [Check out the open-source frontend here if you're interested](https://github.com/sploders101/simplydmx-ui).

I'm curious by nature, and really enjoy finding out how things work, quite often going down rabbit-holes that diversify my knowledge. I can talk for hours about Linux, software architecture, and why Rust is objectively the best language. ðŸ˜‰

I have a strange knack for troubleshooting issues and understanding the inner-workings of frameworks, often designing my own special-purpose frameworks for various things. I love finding ways to make developers' lives easier, and love teaching things to other people.
