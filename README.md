### Welcome to my profile!

My name is Shaun Keys. I am an employee at Charter Communications who enjoys writing software in Vue, TypeScript, SCSS, and Rust.

In my free time, I'm working on SimplyDMX, an iceburg-style stage lighting program designed to be simple on the surface, with a lot more flexibility underneath that runs on Mac, Linux, iPad, and Windows. [Check out the frontend here if you're interested](https://github.com/sploders101/simplydmx-ui).
